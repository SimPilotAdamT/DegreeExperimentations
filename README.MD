# SimPilotAdamT's Degree Experimentations

### What is this repo?
This basically is the repo full of every task I am doing/did for my degree in Computer Science. Nothing will be maintained once completed; everything will be provided as-is without warranty under the GNU GPL v3 License.

Everything can be accessed using the menu provided by the main method in the `experiments` class, in CLI form. Everything will be compiled using the latest OpenJDK version 8, but it should also be compatible with newer versions of the OpenJDK JRE.
